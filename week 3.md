There is use of conditional formatting to present the data information more easily.
there are various options including the following:

Highlight cell rules(Greater than, less than, etc)

## USE OF PIVOT tables and Charts

The pivot table enables cross-tabulated data stored in Excel lists
there is also filtering to edit the data that is not required at that moment 

there is also use of a slicer to break down the data by use of buttons to segment the data

****************************************************************************************************************
## Vlookup function

- It is used to see if a value exists iS a range of values
- to use vlookup we need to create a named range (Block of cells that has a a name and can be referenced

#### The tasks include:
- [x] Create a name range
- [ ] hlookup does the same however it does it horizontally(left to right)
- [ ] hlookup value what are we looking for
- [ ] table array: our range or drag and select
- [ ] col index name: column number in range with what we want
- [ ] range lookup: true(Closest match)/false (should be exact match)
- [ ] if error(vlookup(), "something")

## Data cleaning

- Data errors are causeD by the people that enter the wrong details of data
- Steps in data cleaning include:
  1. Remove any duplicate rows/ columns
  2. Spelling & punctuation
  3. Dealing with nulls - conditional formatting to determine which data is null 
      or inaccurately stated
  4. Dealing with spaces in the data - use of trim

- conditional formatting can be done to assess null values via highlighting them
- You can also use a delimiter /separator to split text into columns
- concatenate- add two or more columns comprising strings

## Use of functions to be able to obtain information can include the use of countif, sumif , len to find the length of the string, left, right, mid function as well

## Other tools may include:
- Sorting - to arrange data into a meaningful format
- pivot tables - data summarization tool used in processing data. They can be used to give quick and clutter-free summary tables
- vlookup
- Data mapping - matching fields of one database to another. It makes it possible to determine the compatibility of data
- depending on schema, data mapping can be done easily ... ** SQL TOPIC ON THE TYPE OF KEYS !! **
