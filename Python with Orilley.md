#The Objectives for week one is: 
# Values and variables
#Display variables and get input from the user
#Assignment 
#Comparison 
#Conditional code
#Numbers
#strings
#If we want to store a value, we declaire variables to enable this 
# The equal sign is the assign operator 
#Variable names should not start with a digit, start or end with _ due to a diff interprataion by the python IDE
#capital is not the same as lower caps
# IN declaring a variable, the values dont have to begin with int 
#Jupyter notebook enables you to not use the print command 
#different types of data cannot be added -- you have to be careful 
# The use of F strings enable one to combine a value -- everything is turned to text including bot numbers and strings
- insert print(f ' then follow with the next commands)

## What does teh f-string do?
What we want , is a string that has dynamic content. That is some part of it will change its value 
- If yours string value will not change, dont use an F string
- If your string contains values from variables , then an f string is best
- TYpes of values inserted in the f-string does not matter because they are all converted into strings behind the scenes
- Inside the curly braces, all code is accepted and will run
## input causes the user to be asked for a prompt 
-- The right side runs before the left side
## Conditions
- =, ==(Returns true or false),
- If, else
-
