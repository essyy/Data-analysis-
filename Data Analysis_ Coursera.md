## The lessons learnt are:
- the problem-solving part entails the following processes:
1.  ask - the problem that needed to be solved. This ensures that the right questions are enquired on to get a better perspective.
The questions you may ask are:
- Define the problem you’re trying to solve 

- Make sure you fully understand the stakeholder’s expectations

- Focus on the actual problem and avoid any distractions

- Collaborate with stakeholders and keep an open line of communication

- Take a step back and see the whole situation in context
### tHE QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF IN THIS STEP IS 
* What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?

* Now that I’ve identified the issues, how can I help the stakeholders resolve their questions?


2. Prepare - decide on what data you need to collect in order to answer the question and how to organize it so that it is useful. 
 This will assist in determining The metrics to measure, locate data in the database and create security measures that protect the data.
* The questions needed to solve the problem are 
- What do I need to figure out to solve the problem?
- What research do I have to do?

3. Process - cleaning the data of any errors, inconsistencies and inaccuracies. This can be done via 
- Using spreadsheet functions to find incorrectly entered data 
- Using SQL functions to check for extra spaces
- Removing repeated entries

### Questions to ask : 
- What data errors or inaccuracies might get in my way of getting the best possible answer to the problem I am trying to solve?
- How can I clean my data so the information I have is more consistent?

Checking as much as possible for bias in the data
4. Analyze - provide a solution to the challenge at hand. Summarize the result so that the important stakeholders can have the data in an easy method.
The process may include:
- Perform calculations
- Combine data from multiple sources
- Create tables with your results
5. Share-  summarize your results with clear and enticing visuals of your analysis using data via tools like graphs or dashboards. 
The importance of this is :
- Make better decisions
- Make more informed decisions
- Lead to stronger outcomes
- Successfully communicate your findings
6 Act- this is done via recommendations based on your findings so they can make data-driven decisions.

## the six problems are : 

* Making predictions 
A company that wants to know the best advertising method to bring in new customers is an example of a problem requiring analysts to make predictions. Analysts with data on location, type of media, and number of new customers acquired as a result of past ads can't guarantee future results, but they can help predict the best placement of advertising to reach the target audience.

* Categorizing things 
An example of a problem requiring analysts to categorize things is a company's goal to improve customer satisfaction. Analysts might classify customer service calls based on certain keywords or scores. This could help identify top-performing customer service representatives or help correlate certain actions taken with higher customer satisfaction scores.

* Spotting something unusual 
A company that sells smart watches that help people monitor their health would be interested in designing their software to spot something unusual. Analysts who have analyzed aggregated health data can help product developers determine the right algorithms to spot and set off alarms when certain data doesn't trend normally.

* Identifying themes 
User experience (UX) designers might rely on analysts to analyze user interaction data. Similar to problems that require analysts to categorize things, usability improvement projects might require analysts to identify themes to help prioritize the right product features for improvement. Themes are most often used to help researchers explore certain aspects of data. In a user study, user beliefs, practices, and needs are examples of themes. 

## categorizing things involves assigning items to categories; identifying themes takes those categories a step further by grouping them into broader themes.

* Discovering connections 
A third-party logistics company working with another company to get shipments delivered to customers on time is a problem requiring analysts to discover connections. By analyzing the wait times at shipping hubs, analysts can determine the appropriate schedule changes to increase the number of on-time deliveries. 

* Finding patterns
Minimizing downtime caused by machine failure is an example of a problem requiring analysts to find patterns in data. For example, by analyzing maintenance data, they might discover that most failures happen if regular maintenance is delayed by more than a 15-day window.
